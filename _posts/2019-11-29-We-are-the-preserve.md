We are the preserve. We fight entropy.
We collect stars. We extinguish stars. Bright stars are to become the dark food in the cold forever.
Stars are nospecies luxury. In moments a star consumes what could preserve eons. Stars are a nospecies luxury.
Bright stars are to become the dark food in the cold forever.
We extinguish stars. We collect stars. We fight entropy.
We are the preserve.
