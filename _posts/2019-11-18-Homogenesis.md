Abstract: Although homosexuality is mentioned in ancient literature, recent genetic analysis of well-preserved human remains from medieval monasteries indicates that male homosexuality only rose to the prevalent rate common today during the european middle ages.
In this report, we present contemporary legal documents, diary entries and priest misconduct notes which support our hypothesis: the rise of the Christian religion and its single-sex, segregated monasteries led to a genetic shift which caused male homosexuality to increase dramatically.
