Abstract: Homosexuality was frequently mentioned in ancient literature, but recent genetic analysis of well-preserved human remains from medieval monasteries indicates that male homosexuality only rose to the prevalent rate common today during the middle ages.
Contemporary legal documents, diary entries and priest misconduct notes support the hypothesis that the rise of the Christian religion and it's single-sex, segregated monasteries led to a genetic change which caused male homosexuality to increase.
In this report, we isolate the specific genetic modifications and reinforce our hypothesis with statistical analysis.
