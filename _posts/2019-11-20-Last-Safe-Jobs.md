title: The Last Safe Jobs for Humans
---

In the last century, automation has liberated human kind from labour and manual work. Most of our modern remaining professions are solely based on creative and mind work, like art, design, programming, and scientific research. This progress was enabled by rapid advances in computer vision, swarm intelligence and communication, specialized artificial intelligence, human-computer interfaces and the rise of neuro-digital circuitry. 
However, one last holdout of human labour is resisting all attempts for automation: indoor waste disposal and living area decontamination still has to be performed by human "cleaning lad/ies".
The main challenges for robotic cleaning systems are indoor navigation in a dynamic, inhomogeneous environment (doors, floors, lifts), disambiguation of waste and intentional disorder, preservation of privacy and discretion, and a quick, quiet, and repeatable cleaning action.
The strongly unionised and high-earning cast of cleaning personnel is actively counteracting research in this area.
Given the current situation, we predict the situation will not change as more and more people find a sense of purpose and solace in cleaning activities, as every other profession is inevitably carried out with super-human performance by machines.
