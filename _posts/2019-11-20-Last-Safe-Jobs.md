title: How the Maidservant Lobby is Fighting for Purpose
---

In the last century, automation has liberated human kind from labour and manual work. Most of our remaining professions are solely based on creative andor mental work, like art, design, architecture, programming, and research. This progress was enabled by rapid advances in specialized artificial intelligence and neuro-digital circuitry. With the increasing likelihood of a technological singularity, all human work is now also at peril, endangering jobs and human purpose.

Well not entirely! One small holdout of indomitable workers still holds out against the upcoming automation by general artificial intelligence: indoor waste disposal and living area decontamination still must be performed by human "cleaning lad/ies".

The main challenges for robotic cleaning systems are indoor navigation in a dynamic, inhomogeneous environment (doors, floors, lifts, obstacles), disambiguation of waste, chaos, and intentional disorder, discretion and preservation of privacy, and quick, quiet, repeatable cleaning action.
The strongly unionised and high-earning cast of Cleaning Personnel is actively counteracting research&development in this area. Given this situation, we predict people will continue finding a sense of purpose and solace in cleaning activities, as every other profession is inevitably carried out with super-human performance by machines.
