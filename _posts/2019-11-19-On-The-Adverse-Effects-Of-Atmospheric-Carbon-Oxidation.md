In scientific literature and the media, it is usually proclaimed that some few PPM of certain gases can modify the climate on our planet. Our research finally offers a plausible explanation for the undeniable changes which have haunted us.

It is often ignored that our planetary atmosphere and ecosystem only contain a finite amount of oxygen and carbon. Much of the carbon is bound in plants and organic matter (as a solid). But as more and more is gasified by thermal reactions with the environment, our atmosphere becomes increasingly more voluminous.
We argue the thusly increased atmospherical crosssection of our planet is introducing a orbital retrograde force by way of friction with the surrounding ether. This would cause an increase of average temperature. The resulting decay of earths orbit around the sun also would cause the average orbit diameter to shrink, forcing the earth closer to the sun, furthering the runaway reaction. We argue that immediate action must be taken by protecting the domestic climate and excavating a larger orbit tunnel for the earth in the ether.
