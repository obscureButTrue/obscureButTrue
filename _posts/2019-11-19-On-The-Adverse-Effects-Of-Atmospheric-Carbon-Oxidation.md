In scientific and colloquial literature, it is often ignored that our atmosphere and ecosystem only contain a finite amount of oxygen and carbon. Much of the carbon is bound in plants and organic matter. But as more and more is released by thermal reactions with the environment, our atmosphere becomes increasingly more voluminous.
We argue that the thusly increased atmospherical cross section of our planet is introducing a retrograde frictional force with the surrounding ether and this causes a further increase of average temperature. The resulting decay of earths orbit around the sun also causes the average orbit diameter to shrink, forcing the earth closer to the sun, furthering the runaway reaction. We argue that immediate action must be taken by protecting the domestic climate and excavating a larger orbit tunnel for the earth in the ether.
