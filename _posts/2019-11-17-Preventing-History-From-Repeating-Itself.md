In the first half of the 22nd century, evidence of several civilisations on earth before our own became pressing. The decrypted artifacts found on the moon tell a clear story: life had emerged from planet earth several times already, only to be incinerated over and over again in nuclear war. Each time, eons of evolution were annihilated. As we are descending into a hopeless debilitating geopolitical chaos yet again, we should not aim to try to prevent collapse in our iteration, but instead aim to make collapse less likely in the next one. As uranium and other radioactive elements are earths only truly non-renewable resources, we should remove as many sources as possible from our earths mantle. This will reduce mining options in future civilisations of earth, and will bring closer the iteration where nuclear war is impossible due to a simple lack of fissile material.
