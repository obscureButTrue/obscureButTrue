After the discovery of the regolith pyramids in the Copernicus Crater on the moon in 2141 the existence of previous human civilizations on earth was finally proven.

The deciphered artifacts tell a clear story: life had emerged on planet earth several times already, only to be incinerated over and over in nuclear cataclysms. Each time, eons of evolution were annihilated in minutes. The debilitating geopolitical chaos we have descended into is not salvageable; our iteration will collapse, even though we have found peace. We shall concentrate our forces to reduce the likelihood of a collapse in the next iteration.

We have determined the best path being the removal of all fissile material from planet earth, which will eventually lead to an iteration of humanity which cannot discover nuclear power. As uranium and other radioactive elements are truly non-renewable resources (as opposed to fossil fuels), we should remove as many deposits as possible from our earths mantle. All warring nations have agreed to use their remaining nanobots for this purpose.

The recommended mandatory disposal method for all collected material will be a planet-wide simultaneous fission event on Dec. 24th 2100 08:00 UTC.
